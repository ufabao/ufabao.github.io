          <h2>About Me</h2>              
          <p>I am a mathematician and computer scientist. I received my Ph.D in Mathematics from Northwestern University in 2023, advised by  <a href="https://antieau.github.io/">Ben Antieau.</a></p>

          
          <h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
          
          <p>
            Recently I have been experimenting with using large language models to translate between human written mathematics and LaTeX'd formal mathematics. On my Github there's a toy transformer model built from scratch that can generate LaTeX code that actually compiles (usually) into realistic looking Algebraic Geometry. Here is a pdf example of some of the math it has generated <a href="output.pdf">Fake Algebraic Geometry,</a> and if you're interested in the code for the model here is the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/ufabao/LaTeX-LM">Algebraic Geometry Transformer.</a>  
          </p>

          <p>
            I've also been exploring the way that diffusion models learn the topology of their target distribution. I have experimentally shown that score based models learn the shape of the data distribution in a very strong sense. Some toy examples can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/ufabao/Topology-of-Diffusion-models">Diffusion of Spheres.</a> 
          </p>

          <p>
            As a converted mathematician I also spend lots of time thinking about PINN's. Here is a very bare bones example of a PINN that learns the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation <a href="https://github.com/ufabao/PINN-experiments">Laplace Equation</a>. 
          </p>

          <h2>Math Research</h2>
          <p>In another life I was a research mathematician, focused on p-adic Hodge theory. My thesis is titled 'Topological Restriction Homology is Locally Even in Characteristic p'. The research portion of my thesis has grown into a larger project, joint with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riggenbachn">Noah Riggenbach,</a> that appears here <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13008">TR of quasiregular semiperfect rings is even</a> and has been submitted for publication.
